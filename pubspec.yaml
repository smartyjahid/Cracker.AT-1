  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Abel
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Abel-Regular.ttf
          weight: 200
    # - family: Open Sans
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/open-sans-bold.ttf
    #       weight: 200
#          style: italic
#         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
#         - asset: fonts/Roboto-MediumItalic.ttf
 #          weight: 500
 #        - asset: fonts/Roboto-LightItalic.ttf
  #         weight: 300

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
